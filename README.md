## Description of project (spec / MVP)

The goal of this project is to have me explore and consolidate my understandings of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project required me to replicate the layout and format of a Window OS using CSS, add content via HTML and control the interactive elements via JavaScript.

## Future Goals

- Separate the code in fake-os-script.js into smaller files
- create folders for each file type
  Keep working on design to make it more real
